This is a mockup of a login form. 
The user enters feeds data and its verified on various basis. The user is notified of the required fields. An error message goes off When they try to submit data without the required information being filled. Various checks are performed such as the length of text, phone numbers and passwords, format of the email and passwords, password and confirmation password match, etc.
