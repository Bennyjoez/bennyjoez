## Login Form (bennyjoez.github.io/odin-form) ❤️
 This is a mockup of a login form. The user enters feeds data and its verified on various basis.The user is notified of the required fields when they try to submit data without the required information being filled to a certain specifications such as length of text, phone numbers and passwords, format of the email and passwords; password and confirmation password match. 
 The input fields change background color when the check paramters are met; ✅
